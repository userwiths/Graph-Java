Implementation of a graph in java.

Take a look at GraphTest.java to see how to invoke it on practice.
Take a look at GraphTable.java if you want the real programming thing.

Note that this implementation is (as the name mentions), a table graph.
This means that it is a bit faster than a Vertex graph, but needs
space equal to ((size of element)*(number of elements))^2.
It would requere many elements in order to bring it down,
but when their number increases it will start eating up much more memory.
